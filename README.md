Explanation of the Code
1. HTML Structure

The code begins with <!DOCTYPE html> which tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

The <html> element wraps all the content of the page.

The <head> section contains metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings (for responsiveness), title, and internal CSS styling.

The <body> section contains the actual visible content like header, section, image, button, and JavaScript.

2. Header Section
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage created as part of my web development journey.</p>
</header>


<header> is used to group introductory content.

Inside it, an <h1> heading welcomes users and a <p> paragraph gives a short description.

The background color is green (#4CAF50) with white text for emphasis.

3. About Me Section
<section>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm learning web development. It's fun and creative!</p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Placeholder Image">
    <p>Check out more about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>.</p>
</section>


<section> is used to organize related content.

Contains a heading <h2> and description about the learner.

An <img> tag displays a placeholder image.

A link (<a>) opens W3Schools in a new tab (target="_blank"), providing learning resources.

4. Button & JavaScript
<button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me!</button>
<script>
    function showMessage() {
        alert("Hello! You clicked the button.");
    }
</script>


A <button> is added that triggers a JavaScript function showMessage() when clicked.

The function displays a popup alert message (“Hello! You clicked the button.”).

This shows the interaction between HTML and JavaScript.

5. CSS Styling

Body: Sets font, background color (#f2f2f2), and text color (#333).

Header: Green background with white text, centered content.

Section: White background with padding, margin, rounded corners, and a shadow for a card-like effect.

Images: Set to scale responsively with max-width: 100%.

Buttons: Blue background, rounded edges, and hover effect for interactivity.

Summary

This webpage demonstrates:

HTML → Structure (header, section, image, link, button).

CSS → Styling (colors, layout, hover effects, responsive image).

JavaScript → Simple interactivity (alert message when button is clicked).

It is a beginner-friendly project that introduces the core building blocks of web development (HTML, CSS, JS) in one file.
